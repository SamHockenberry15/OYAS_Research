In 2009, the University of Cincinnati Corrections Institute published a report on a new tool called the Ohio Youth Assessment System (OYAS) that identifies the needs and risks of juvenile offenders. This report describes five tools that make up the OYAS and their initial results on arrested and rearrested youth. This project uses the results of this report as a base to recreate representative data and discover new findings. Through cluster analysis we hope to identify common characteristics of arrested and rearrested youth to allow for more informed decisions concerning the health and safety of adjudicated youth.
